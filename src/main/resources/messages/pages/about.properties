app.about.hobbies=<p>My experiences and passions outside of work are fundamental pillars of my soft skills, which I consistently apply in my daily professional life.</p>\
<p><strong>Game development</strong> and <strong>playing games</strong>, especially strategy and RPGs, have honed my analytical and strategic abilities, complex problem-solving, and critical thinking. These activities teach me to plan ahead, adapt to constantly changing scenarios, and identify effective solutions under pressure.</p>\
<p>My wide range of interests in <strong>reading</strong> from history and philosophy to technology, science, and science fiction, demonstrates an insatiable curiosity and a strong desire for continuous learning. This diversity of knowledge allows me to approach challenges from different perspectives and facilitates adaptation to new information and technologies.</p>\
<p>The study of <strong>music</strong> and instruments has developed my discipline, patience, and attention to detail, while also strengthening my coordination and persistence in mastering new skills.</p>\
<p>The practice of <strong>martial arts</strong> (Kung Fu, Karate, Jiu-Jitsu) has cultivated discipline, focus, resilience, and the ability to handle challenges in a structured way, in addition to promoting a strong sense of self-control and respect. My interest in returning to and exploring Kendo reinforces my continuous pursuit of improvement and new challenges.</p>\
<p>These combined skills allow me to act as a versatile, adaptable, and highly motivated professional, always seeking learning and excellence in my responsibilities.</p>
